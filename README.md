#ALFA: Annotation Landscape For Aligned reads

ALFA provides a global overview of features distribution composingcontained in a among NGS dataset(s). Given a set of aligned reads (BAM files) and an annotation file (GTF format), the tool produces plots of the raw and normalized distributions of those reads among genomic categories (stop codon, 5'-UTR, CDS, intergenic, etc.) and biotypes (protein coding genes, miRNA, tRNA, etc.).
